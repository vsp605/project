                <h3>1. Web Based Integration</h3>
                <p>A user-friendly web application acts as the gateway to the smart parking experience. The Web provides users with a wealth of information, from real-time parking availability to directions to the nearest open spot. Users can reserve and pay for parking spaces directly through the Web, making the process seamless and convenient.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>2. Reservation and Pre-Booking</h3>
                <p>The ability to reserve a parking spot in advance is a valuable feature of smart parking systems. Always use a smart Security System supplier for access control. Users can secure a parking space before arriving at their destination, ensuring they have a guaranteed spot and minimizing the time spent searching for parking upon arrival.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>3. Contactless Payments</h3>
